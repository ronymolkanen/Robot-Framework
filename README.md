# Learning Robot Framework
In school we have a module called **Software Testing**. In this module I got to know about software testing, expecially Robot Framework.

## In this repository I have robot and python files. 
* projekti.robot file was about the project of the course which idea was to test JIMMS's webpage different ways.
* In _Pythonfiles_ and _RobotFiles_ folders I have some excercises which I did during the course. Including the classic Fizz-Buzz test :smile:
